## General Information
You work for a consumer finance company Lending Club which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers.
 
 When a person applies for a loan, there are two types of decisions that could be taken by the company:


**Loan accepted:** If the company approves the loan, there are 2  possible scenarios described below:

    **Fully paid:** Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)
    **Charged-off:** Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan

**Loan rejected:** The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)

**Objective:**

Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refusesto pay or runs away with the money owed.  

The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants,then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   

Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
